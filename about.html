## About

I am a web-developer based in the Cologne / Aachen area in Germany. I am excited to be involved  
in the most important technological development of our era, and I love to use my web development  
skills to help people fulfil their business and personal requirements.

Starting with writing a successful mod for the game Silent Hunter 3, I became interested in     
programming in general. I then started learning python, and from there, in response to a request for  
a volunteer I joined a web project where I started learning javascript and C#. 

Now I am a full-stack web-developer with my main compentency in Node.js, but also ASP.net.
